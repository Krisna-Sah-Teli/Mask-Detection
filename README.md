# Mask-Detection
This is the real time application of machine learning model to detect whether one is wearing mask or not.
I have used TensorFlow and MobileNetV2 in order to design the model. I have also used pre trained weight values for this model which helps to reduce the execution time and more I have also blocked updation part which allows model to only undergoes training without being under goes for updation.
This model shows extremely good prediction with accuracy 99.37% and loss 1.92%.
